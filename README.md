# Dockeraise
Raise a full Docker setup in your server in seconds!

*Very* simple bash script to automate the installation of Docker on Debian servers. It also lets you choose if you want to install Docker Compose, and to create a Docker user.

(Only tested on fresh Debian 11 installations. Use at your own risk.)
