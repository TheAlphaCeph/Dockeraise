# Dockeraise
Raise a full Docker installation in your server with ease!

Simple bash script to automate the installation of Docker (and Docker compose) on servers running Debian. 
It also lets you create a Docker user.

> Should work on both Debian 11 and 12. Only tested on fresh Debian 12 installations. Reviewing the code is recommended.

***
You can either [download](https://github.com/Zerodya/dockeraise/blob/main/dockeraise.sh) the script and run it manually, or use the following command:
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zerodya/dockeraise/main/dockeraise.sh | bash
```
